<h2 id="introheader">About The Mouse</h2>
<p>Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928.</p>

<h2 id="Historyheader">History</h2>

<h3>The Early Years</h3>

<p>The early days of Mickey Mouse demonstrate a version of him that present-day viewers might not quite recognize. The first Mickey cartoon produced, Plane Crazy, suggests his mischievous side, as we see a young, scrappy Mickey looking for trouble and adventure. One might observe him as overconfident and bold toward his female co-star, Minnie Mouse. These early days of Mickey present a happy-go-lucky character, but one that displays slight juvenile behavior. Steamboat Willie (1928), the first Mickey Mouse cartoon to be publicly released, shows Mickey flirtatiously pursuing Minnie Mouse, playing with animals as if they are instruments, and discovering his curiosity and love of music; Mickey’s actions are typified by that of a teenager or young boy. It wasn’t really until Mickey started speaking in The Karnival Kid (1929) that he was given more relatable attributes.</P>

<p>As for Mickey’s look, in Plane Crazy there is no sight of his iconic white gloves or his oversized shoes. He didn’t even have a consistent number of fingers during this time, as the number alternated between four and five. It wasn’t until later on that they eventually settled on three fingers and a thumb. As for Mickey’s shoes, his trademark footwear is introduced in the second Mickey cartoon produced, The Gallopin’ Gaucho (1928), and has stayed with him almost ever since. But when did Mickey’s gloves come into play? In the 1929 cartoon, The Opry House, the gloves made their debut appearance as part of his stage costume, but had the added effect of distinguishing his hands from his body. His trademark gloves became a permanent fixture in the following short, When the Cat’s Away (1929), and has remained part of his design ever since. Of course, Mickey’s face was subject to some changes, too. Unlike Plane Crazy, where his eyes occupy almost his entire face, in Steamboat Willie his eyes were redesigned as small, black ovals giving Mickey a greater range of facial expression. </p>


<h3> The Sorcerer’s Apprentice</h3>
<p> “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” now incorporated into Fantasia (1940), displays Mickey as a character who is eager to learn, but still yearning for a bit of fun. Walt planned “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” to bring Mickey back into the spotlight, after the Donald Duck shorts had somewhat eclipsed Mickey’s popularity. Mickey was redesigned during this era, shifting to a more realistic interpretation; his eyes now featured pupils instead of the previous black ovals. It is this version of Mickey that persists throughout the years, as his relationship with Minnie grows and his life settles down. Mickey still enjoys adventure, but his personality is calm and kind. </p>

<h3>Mickey Mouse Today</h3>
<p>Today, we recognize Mickey Mouse in his iconic red shorts, yellow shoes, and white gloves. He is optimistic, brave, and lovable. Mickey undoubtedly stands as the global ambassador of The Walt Disney Company, and without him, Walt might not have found his success. As Walt once said, “it was all started by a mouse.”</p>
